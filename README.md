## December 2024 Report
The updated design is similar to the previous design but with changes made to hold all of the new components in place. It follows a similar layering system, with parts spread across three layers, each screwed down with socket heads to keep them together.

All of this attaches via a skyport extension to the DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone. While the overall shape and design of the payload is similar to the previous design, the biggest change is size, since there are more parts included. Changes can still be made if sizing needs to change, or any updates need to be made to the overall shape of each layer. 

Each part was placed in each layer because of design requirements that needed to be followed and the fact that cable routing makes the most sense this way. For potential issues, 
- The payload is much larger than the previous design, so space might need to be conserved
- Cable management could be a hassle considering the amount of cables that will be in the payload
